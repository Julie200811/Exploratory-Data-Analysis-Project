# ExploratoryDataAnalysis-AirQuality(USA)

In this project I have tried to do exploratory US Air-Quality data using R-programming and its library (ggplot2) to see imp pattern involved in contributing factor of US pollution.

Fine particulate matter (PM_{2.5}) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM_{2.5}. 

This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the [EPA National Emissions Inventory](http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html)

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records shows how many tons of PM_{2.5} were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data points that I  have used for this analysis are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
